# OP_CAT

## Overview

The `OP_CAT` (Concatenate) opcode is a part of the Bitcoin scripting language. It allows for the concatenation of two strings or sets of bytes within a Bitcoin script. This operation combines the contents of two stack elements, resulting in a single stack element that contains the concatenated data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `OP_CAT` is to enable more flexible and advanced operations within Bitcoin scripts. By allowing the concatenation of data, developers can construct more complex data structures and manipulate information within scripts, contributing to the development of sophisticated smart contracts and applications on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Usage

To use `OP_CAT`, the two stack elements at the top of the stack are popped, concatenated, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. The concatenated data can then be used in subsequent operations within the script.

## Example

```bitcoin
OP_PUSHDATA1 <data1>
OP_PUSHDATA1 <data2>
OP_CAT
```

**Explanation:**
- `<data1>` and `<data2>` are placeholders for the data or values to be concatenated.
- `OP_PUSHDATA1` is an opcode to push data onto the stack.
- `OP_CAT` concatenates the top two stack elements.
